* Massive upgrade to the included steps.  There are now steps for almost everything you can do in splinter, with friendly, consistent syntax!
* Features written for all of salad's steps. That's 100% test coverage, folks!
* `browser` steps are now a module, organized by the area of interaction (forms, mouse, etc).  `import steps.browser` will still behave as before.
* Future-proofing: `I access the url` is now deprecated in favor of the friendlier `I visit the url`.  "visit", "access" and "open" will all be valid actions for visiting a web page going forward.
* Backwards-incompatable: `should see "some text"` has changed meaning.

    * If you mean *this text should appear somewhere in the HTML for this page*, use `should see "some text" somewhere in the page`.
    * If you mean *the element that I am about to describe should be in the page and be visible*, use `should see <subject>`
    * Note: Backwards-incompatable changes will not be the norm around here - at the moment, I'm fairly sure I know everywhere salad is being used, so I'd rather make the jump and get things right.  Future backwards-incompatible changes will go through a deprecation schedule.

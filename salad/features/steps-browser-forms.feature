Feature: Ensuring that the forms steps work
    In order to make sure that the forms module works
    As a developer
    I test against the form test files

    Scenario: Filling in a field with random content and recalling the content
        Given I visit the salad test url "browser/form.html"
          And I look around
         When I store a random <what> of length 20 as "string_with_length"
          And I fill in the 1st element named "fill_me_in" with the stored value of "string_with_length"
         Then I should see that the value of the field named "fill_me_in" is the stored value of "string_with_length"
         When I store a random <what> as "string"
          And I fill in the 2nd element with the xpath "//div[@id='fill_in']/input" with the stored value of "string"
         Then I should see that the value of the 2nd field named "fill_me_in" is the stored value of "string"
         When I store a random <what> with suffix " suffix" as "string_with_suffix"
          And I fill in the 3rd element named "fill_me_in" with the stored value of "string_with_suffix"
         Then I should see that the value of the 3rd field named "fill_me_in" is the stored value of "string_with_suffix"
         When I store a random <what> of length 10 with suffix " restaurant" as "string_with_length_and_suffix"
          And I fill in the 4th element named "fill_me_in" with the stored value of "string_with_length_and_suffix"
         Then I should see that the value of the last field named "fill_me_in" is the stored value of "string_with_length_and_suffix"

        | what   |
        | string |

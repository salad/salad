Feature: Ensuring that the forms steps work
    In order to make sure that the forms module works
    As a developer
    I test against the form test files

    Scenario Outline: 1. Seeing things in fields
        Given I visit the salad test url "browser/form.html"
         When I look around
         Then I should see that the <what> of the element with the css selector "<finder>" is "<value>"
          And I should not see that the <what> of the element with the css selector "<finder>" is "this is not it"

    Examples:
        | what  | finder            | value                            |
        | value | fieldset input    | This is the value                |
        | text  | fieldset textarea | This is the text: 123!                |
